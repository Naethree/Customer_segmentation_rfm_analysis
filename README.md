This project focuses on customer segmentation using RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis to identify distinct customer groups based on their purchasing behavior. I applied RFM analysis to segment customers into meaningful categories, helping businesses tailor their marketing strategies effectively.

The project was implemented in R, where I calculated RFM scores, performed segmentation, and provided insights into customer value and behavior patterns. This segmentation enables businesses to better understand their customer base and optimize their engagement strategies.
